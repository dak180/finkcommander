 FinkCommander

 Graphical user interface for Fink, a software package management system
 that automates the downloading, patching, compilation and installation of
 Unix software on Mac OS X.

 AuthorizedExecutable uses an NSTask to run the Launcher tool with administrative
 privileges.  It communicates with Launcher, and thus with fink or apt-get subprocesses,
 through pipes and sends the output from the subprocesses to FinkController through 
 delegate methods.
