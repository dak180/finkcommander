<a name="description">Overview</a>
</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net"
target="top">FinkCommander</a> provides a GUI frontend to the <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net" target="top">Fink</a> package manager.  You will
need to <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/"
target="top">install Fink</a> itself in order for FinkCommander to be
of any use.
</p>

<p>
FinkCommander is designed to be intuitive.  A fairly extensive set of
help files is nevertheless included.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter bugs, it would be very helpful to have them reported
at the SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48896&atid=454467"
target="top">Bug Tracker</a> for FinkCommander.
</p>

<p>
I will not be able to provide direct support for FinkCommander.
Software development is my hobby.  I have a pretty demanding "day
job," so responding directly to every request for help is just not in
the cards.  I will, however, take your comments into account in
designing and drafting documentation for future versions of
FinkCommander.  Please send comments (other than bug reports) to my <a
href="mailto:sburrious@users.sourceforge.net">SourceForge email account</a>.
