<h2>Running Fink and Apt-Get Commands</h2>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>Running commands is straightforward.  If the command is package specific
(e.g. "install"), select a package or packages in the table and choose
the command you want from the source or binary menus or the toolbar.
To select more than one package, just shift- or command-click as you
would in any other table</p>

<p>To run a command that doesn't apply to specific packages
(e.g. "selfupdate"), simply choose the command from the menu.</p>

<p>The toolbar has a number of available commands that are not included in
the default configuration.  To customize the toolbar, select
<kbd>Window:Customize Toolbar</kbd>.

<p>When a command is running, the name of the command and (space
allowing) a list of the packages it applies to will appear as a text
message in the lower left-hand corner of the window.  When the command
is finished, a progress bar and the message "Updating table data" may
appear.  <a href="details/fc_tableupdate.html">More detail</a>.  While
either of these processes is underway, the menu and toolbar items for
running commands will be disabled.

Between commands, the number of packages currently displayed
by the table will appear.</p>

<h3>Source vs. Binary</h3>

<p>The commands under the <kbd>Source</kbd> menu are run by the fink
package manager.  The commands under the <kbd>Binary</kbd> menu are
run by apt-get.  In general, fink handles packages available as source
code and apt-get handles packages available in binary form.  Hence the
menu names.</p>

<p>This dichotomy, however, does not always hold true.  For
example, if you install a source code package,
remove it and then reinstall it before a newer version becomes
available, fink will use the dpkg command to reinstall a compressed
binary package that it has installed on your system.</p>

<h3>Finding Packages</h3>

<p>FinkCommander provides two handy tools for finding the packages you
might be interested in installing or removing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers,
just as you can in Mail and other applications.  Click a header twice
in a row to reverse the sort order.</p></li>

<li><p>The toolbar in its default configuration includes a filter
that can be applied to most of the fields in the table.  (I didn't
think anyone would want to filter by version number.)  The filter
works incrementally, so that as you type or delete characters, the
contents of the table change to include only those packages that
satisfy your search criteria.  The package count at the bottom of the
window also changes to reflect the table contents.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By combining the use of sorting and filtering, you can effectively
search the table with two criteria.</p>

<p>The table colums, by the way, can be resized and moved, and any
such changes you make will be saved between runtimes.</p>
