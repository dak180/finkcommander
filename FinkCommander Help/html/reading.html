<h2>Getting Information on Packages from the Table</h2>

<h3>Unstable</h3>

<p>If there is an asterisk in the unstable column for a package, it means
that the most recent available version is in the unstable tree.  It does
<strong>not necessarily</strong> mean that you have an unstable version 
installed.</p>

<h3>Version</h3>

<p>The number in the version column represents the most
recent available version of the package.</p>

<h3>Finding Packages</h3>

<p>FinkCommander provides two handy tools for finding the packages you
might be interested in installing or removing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers,
just as you can in Mail and other applications.  Click a header twice
in a row to reverse the sort order.</p></li>

<li><p>The toolbar in its default configuration includes a filter
that can be applied to most of the fields in the table.  (I didn't
think anyone would want to filter by version number.)  The filter
works incrementally, so that as you type or delete characters, the
contents of the table change to include only those packages that
satisfy your search criteria.  The package count at the bottom of the
window also changes to reflect the table contents.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By combining the use of sorting and filtering, you can effectively
search the table with two criteria.</p>

<p>The table colums, by the way, can be resized and moved, and any
such changes you make will be saved between runtimes.</p>
