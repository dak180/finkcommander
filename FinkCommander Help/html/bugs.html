<h2>Known Bugs and Limitations</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Terminating commands</dt>
    <dd><p>There is currently no way to terminate a command other than
        to quit FinkCommander.  In my experience, Fink has done an excellent 
		job of recovering from aborted commands.
        YMMV, of course.</p></dd>
	
    <dt>Automatic response to prompt failures</dt>
    <dd><p>In some instances, Fink will not automatically respond to a prompt
		when <kbd>Preferences:General:Always choose default response to prompts</kbd> 
		is selected. When this occurs, select <kbd>Tools:Interact with Fink</kbd> to enter
		a response.  <a href="details/fc_defaults.html">More detail</a>.
    </p></dd>
	
    <dt>Incorrect error messages</dt>
    <dd><p>FinkCommander sometimes reports possible errors in running a fink
        command when none has in fact occurrred.  However, when a possible error
        is detected, FinkCommander performs a full update of the table.  If the table
        reflects what you would expect to see after a successful command (e.g., the
        package you just installed from source is shown as <dfn>current</dfn>), then the 
		error message was a false positive.  You don't need to worry about it.
    </p></dd>
    
    <dt>Binary install failures</dt>
    <dd><p>When you try to use <kbd>Binary:Install</kbd> to install some
        packages identifed in the table as binary, FinkCommander will generate an
        error message.  If this happens, you will need to use
        <kbd>Source:Install</kbd> to install the package.  
        <a href="details/fc_binarypkgs.html">More detail</a>.
    </p></dd>
	
	<dt>Apt-get update failure</dt>
	<dd><p>If you receive an error message after running apt-get update, try running
		<kbd>Source:Scanpackages</kbd> and then trying apt-get update again.
	</p></dd>
    
    <dt>Incorrect table entries</dt>
    <dd><p>If you turn off the <dfn>Alway update table with Fink</dfn>
        option, FinkCommander will attempt to update the data in the
        table, but the result will be at best a very rough
        approximation of the true state of your installation.  To get
        a complete update, turn the option back on, or run
        <kbd>File:Update table</kbd>.
        <a href="details/fc_tableupdate.html">More detail</a>.
    </p></dd> 
    
    <dt>Tcsh package problem</dt>
    <dd><p>The selection of tcsh is disabled, because FinkCommander
        stalls when trying to install this package.  Installing from
        the command-line works fine.  Please file a <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48896&atid=454467"
        target="top">bug report</a> if you encounter the same problem
        with another package.
    </p></dd>
