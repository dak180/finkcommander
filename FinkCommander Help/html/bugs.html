<h2>Known Bugs and Limitations</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Terminating Commands</dt>
    <dd><p>There is currently no way to terminate a command other than to quit
    FinkCommander.</p></dd>

    <dt>Incorrect error messages</dt>
    <dd><p>FinkCommander sometimes reports possible errors in running a fink
        command when none has in fact occurrred.  However, when a possible error
        is detected, FinkCommander performs a full update of the table.  If the table
        reflects what you would expect to see after a successful command (e.g., the
        package you just installed is shown as <dfn>current</dfn>, then the error message
        was a false positive.
    </p></dd>
    
    <dt>Binary install failures</dt>
    <dd><p>When you try to use <kbd>Binary:Install</kbd> to install some
        packages identifed in the table as binary, FinkCommander will generate an
        error message.  If this happens, you will need to use
        <kbd>Source:Install</kbd> to install the package.

    </p></dd>
    
    <dt>Incorrect table entries</dt>
    <dd><p>If you turn off the <dfn>Alway update table with Fink</dfn> option, 
        FinkCommander will attempt to update the data in the table, but it will be
        at best a very rough approximation.  To get a complete update, turn the option
        back on, or run <kbd>File:Update table</kbd>.

    </p></dd> 
    
    <dt>Tcsh package problem</dt>
    <dd><p>The selection of tcsh is disabled, because FinkCommander stalls when trying
        to install this package.  Installing from the command-line works fine.
    </p></dd>
