<h3>Binary Packages</h3>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="10">
<tr><td>
FinkCommander uses the apt-cache program to identify packages that
are available in binary format.  The apt-cache generated list 
includes packages that the Fink project developers have made available
in binary form and <em>source packages that you have at some point
installed on your system</em>.  When a package belongs the second
group but not the first, selecting <kbd>Binary:Install</kbd> (i.e. "apt-get
install") will generate an error message.
</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td> 
If this happens, and you want to make sure you have the latest version
of the package, or you have removed the package and want to reinstall,
select Source:Install.
</td></tr>
