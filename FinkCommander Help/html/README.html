<a name="description">Overview</a>
</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net"
target="top">FinkCommander</a> provides a GUI frontend to the <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net" target="top">Fink</a> package manager.  You will
need to <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/"
target="top">install Fink</a> itself in order for FinkCommander to be
of any use.
</p>

<p>
FinkCommander is designed to be intuitive.  A fairly extensive set of
help files is nevertheless included.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter bugs, it would be very helpful to have them reported
at the SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48896&atid=454467"
target="top">Bug Tracker</a> for FinkCommander.
</p>

<p>
I will not be able to provide direct support for FinkCommander.
Software development is my hobby.  I have a pretty demanding "day
job," so responding directly to every request for help is just not in
the cards.  I will, however, take your comments into account in
designing and drafting documentation for future versions of
FinkCommander.  Please send comments (other than bug reports) to my <a
href="mailto:sburrious@users.sourceforge.net">SourceForge email account</a>.

<h3><a name="security">Note on Security</a></h3>

<p>
FinkCommander does not use Apple's Security Framework to authorize commands
requiring administrator privileges.  Instead, it asks you to enter your password
in a text field and then passes it along to the sudo command.  
</p>

<p>
Please note that FinkCommander does not itself run as root.  Instead, it uses the sudo command
to run Fink as root, just as Fink itself does.  I believe that the main concern about this 
approach is that <strong>you are giving your password to FinkCommander</strong>.  
If FinkCommander were evil software, it could use the password do mischief to your system.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, FinkCommander is free software, so what it does
with your password is transparent.  If you have concerns, I would
encourage you to obtain and look at the source code to confirm what the
program is doing with your password.
</p>

<p>
I have been studying the Security Framework and Apple's recommended method
for running privileged operations, as exemplified in the 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Security/AuthSample.htm">AuthSample</a> 
code sample.  It appears that using this method to perform the 
complex inter-process communication that FinkCommander engages in will be extremely
difficult, at least for an amateur programmer like me.  
FinkCommander is likely to remain in its present form indefinitely.
