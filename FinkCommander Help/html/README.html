<a name="description">Overview</a>
</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net">FinkCommander</a> provides a GUI
frontend to the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</a> package manager.  You
will need to <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/">install Fink</a> itself in order for 
FinkCommander to be of any use.
</p>

<p>
On startup, FinkCommander loads fink package data into a table.  To run a
command, simply select the package(s), if any, to which the command should apply
and select the appropriate command from the "Source" or "Binary" menu.  For information
on the Fink commands, try the on-line 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/users-guide/index.php">Fink User's Guide</a>
</p>

<p>
A limited amount of customization is available via the FinkCommander:Preferences menu.  More 
is on the way.
</p>

<p>
Please note that this software is still in the early stages of development.  It
could break your system or even <a href="#security"><strong>present a security risk</strong></a>.
</p>

<p>
If you're brave enough to try FinkCommander, the 
<a href="mailto:sburrious@users.sourceforge.net">developer</a> would very much
appreciate your comments.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter bugs, it would be very helpful to have them reported at the
SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48896&atid=454467">
Bug Tracker</a> for FinkCommander.  
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I will not be able to provide direct support for FinkCommander. 
Software development is my hobby.  I have a pretty demanding "day job," so
responding directly to every request for help is just not in the cards.

<h3><a name="security">Note on Security</a></h3>

FinkCommander does not yet use Apple's Security Framework to authorize commands
requiring administrator privileges.  Instead, it asks you to enter your password
in a text field and then passes it along to the sudo command.  This means that
<strong>you are giving your password to FinkCommander</strong>.  If I were in
your shoes, I would think twice about this.  If FinkCommander were evil
software, it could use the password do real mischief to your system.

<p>
The one protection you have against misuse is that FinkCommander is open source
software.  I would encourage you to obtain and look at the source code to see
what the program is doing with your password.
