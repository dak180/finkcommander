VERSION HISTORY

0.3.0	5/12/2002:
	
	Fink.conf can now be modified using the Preferences panel
	
	Output window scrolling behavior now mimics Terminal.app:  Unless the user 
	chooses "Scroll to the bottom . . ." in Preferences, the user can now scroll 
	up to view previous output without having the scroller zip back down to the 
	bottom every time new output is added
	
	Other new preference items: warn before running a command (as requested), never
	ask for password (for users who have configured sudo accordingly), ask for 
	password on startup
	
	All fields except version can now be filtered
	
	Additional available toolbar items:  selfupdate, apt-get update, selfupdate-cvs, 
	describe, interact with Fink
	
	Help now includes instructions on running commands and on setting Preferences

0.2.1a	4/27/2002:

	Fixed bug preventing use of apt-get from behind firewall

0.2.1	4/24/2002:

	Added menu item allowing user to summon interaction sheet
	
	Fixed bug causing crash on startup if Fink not installed in one of 
	certain directories
	
0.2.0	4/20/2002:
	
	First binary release

    Added toolbar, which includes an incremental filter for table data

    Added progress indicator bar that appears at bottom of window when table is
    updating

    Moved status/package number message to bottom of window
	
    Added warning alert when user attempts to quit Fink while a command is still
    running 
    
    Full table update performed after error message detected

    Disabled row selection and added alert when user selects package FC cannot
    install (just tcsh, at this point)

    Cleaned up some memory allocation errors

0.1.3	04/05/2002:

    First SourceForge release

    /sw no longer hard-coded as fink directory path

    FC now searches for path, sets user defaults to reflect result and writes
    path into fpkg_list.pl script

    Interaction with Fink prompts enabled through sheet dialog that appears
    whenever input is needed. Password only entered when needed.

    Added preferences panel: accept Fink defaults automatically when running
    commands; set fink directory path manually, if search method doesn't work;
    always update table data with fink commands; scroll to last selection after
    sort.

    Window position and table column states now saved between sessions

    Table selection no longer disabled while command is running; no longer
    necessary for update.

    Message text now signals when a full update of the package data is
    occurring.

    The table now resorts after a full update of the package data

    FinkCommander now has its own icon!  Since I'm no artist, it's ugly, but at
    least it makes identifying FinkCommander easier than the generic application
    icon

0.1.2	03/10/2002:

    Added table column showing whether package is unstable.

    Password entry sheet now appears automatically the first time a command is
    attempted; also after invalid password alert is dismissed; basically an
    improved implementation of the password entry procedure in 0.1

    FC disables Source and Binary menus and table row selection while command is
    running

    Added Selfupdate-cvs to Source menu and Remove to Binary menu

    Removed commands from the Binary menu that do not appear useful; users
    should let me know if I went too far! System beeps when command finishes
    (Woo woo!)

0.1.1	03/05/2002:

    Added explicit data encoding to methods sending text to standard input of
    NSTask; passing C string as data may have been cause of a reported user
    crash

    Simplified password entry procedures, another possible cause of the crash

    The current procedure is in any case a placeholder until I can figure out
    how to work in the Security Framework functions

    Eliminated error-prone method for determining user's Fink directory, which
    may have caused a reported failure of the table to load on one user's system

    Added documentation

0.1		03/03/2002: Initial release, errors galore reported.
