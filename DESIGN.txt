OVERVIEW

FinkCommander currently relies on inter-process communication (IPC) to gather information about fink packages and execute fink commands.  There has been discussion on the fink developers' mailing list about the possibility that an Objective C-Perl bridge will eliminate the need for at least some IPC and enhance functionality.  This document sets forth my thoughts on the subject as they evolve.

Dave Vasilevsky has pointed out that it would therefore make sense to make FinkCommander more modular so that it will be easier to replace the existing IPC code with code relying on the Obj C-Perl bridge.  To accomplish this, I have taken most of the code relating to running fink and apt-get commands out of FinkController and put it into the IOTaskWrapperClass.

Comments on the feasibility of implementing particular features with an Obj C-Perl bridge relate to fink only.  Installing binaries with apt-get requires a different approach.

OBJECTIVE C-PERL BRIDGE

A bridge is now available.  I have downloaded the framework and written a prototype application that uses the bridge rather than IPC to gather information for the FC table.  I will eventually incorporate the framework and this code into FC.  At the moment, I'm having a hard time seeing how I could go much farther with this.  See notes below.

TYPES OF INTERACTION BETWEEN FC AND FP

(1)  Getting Information into Table

Sequence:
FC message to FP requesting info on packages
FP sends array of FinkPackage instances to FC 
FC displays package info in table

Status in current FinkCommander:
Implemented through NSTask and NSPipe in the FinkDataController class
 
Feasibility of Implementing through Obj C-Perl bridge:
Piece of cake.  Even I can see that.  

(2)  Executing Fink or Apt-get Command

Sequence:
FC receives menu command, asks table which rows are selected
FC sends program name (fink or apt-get), command name and package names to FP
FP runs command with administrator privileges

Status in current FinkCommander:
Implemented through creation of IOTaskWrapper object.  IOTaskWrapper is a modified version of the TaskWrapper class in Apple's "Moriarity" example:
http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Cocoa/Moriarity.htm
Authentication is currently handled by having the user enter his password in a secure text field and passing it to the IOTaskWrapper object.  (This is not the correct way of doing it.)

Feasibility of implementing through Obj C-Perl bridge:
I am not certain.  Discussions on the Omni-Web and Apple mailing lists for Cocoa developers indicate that a running process cannot change its own authorization.  Instead, it must execute a subprocess with administrator privileges using the Security Framework.  This would seem to suggest that FinkCommander could not use the Obj C-Perl bridge to call a fink subroutine with administrator privileges.  On the other hand, I know so little about this stuff that I could easily be wrong, and hope I am. 

(3)  Responding to Fink Request for Input

E.g. pick a virtual dependency, agree to download dependencies, choose option when download fails

Sequence:
While running command, FP receives request for user input
FP sends request to FC
FC displays panel, preferably in sheet form, asking for user response
FC sends user response to FP
FP sends user response to running command

Status in current FinkCommander:
Not yet implemented, but the plumbing is there.  FinkCommander already reads stdout from the running process, parses it for prompts and writes a "\n" to the process stdin in order to select the default. 

Feasibility of implementing through Obj C-Perl bridge:
Seems possible, but wouldn't the fink subroutines need to be altered?  They appear to rely directly on stdin and stdout for user interaction.

(4)	 Sending stdout from running command to text view in real time

Sequence:
FP receives chunk of output from running command
FC adds output to text view and scrolls to end

Status in current FinkCommander:
Implemented through IOTaskWrapper appendOutput protocol

Feasibility of implementing through Obj C-Perl bridge:
Seems doubtful.  Fink appears to rely on the Perl system function to execute the scripts and programs that download, patch, configure, build and install the packages.  System does not capture the standard output from the executed script or program.  If fink itself were modified to use popen to return the output to the caller, this might become possible.

(5)  Sending CVS password to selfupdate-cvs command; needed for fink core developers
