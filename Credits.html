<p>I have found the following to be extremely valuable in my quest to learn Cocoa and in 
developing FinkCommander:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The book <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/Book/">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a> by Aaron Hillegass.  This is a superlative introduction to Cocoa.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Mike Beam's <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/ct/37">Cocoa tutorials</a>, especially the tutorials on toolbars and customizing table columns, which I borrowed from heavily in writing FinkCommander.</p></li>
		
	<li><p>The <a href="http://www.cocoadevcentral.com/">Cocoa Dev Central web site</a>, another great source of tutorials.</p></li>

	<li><p>The open source code and programming tips for <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/hoshi_takanori/cocoa-browser/">Cocoa Browser</a> by Hoshi Takanori and Max Horn.  FinkCommander uses Cocoa Browser's "MyTextView" class to make the hand icon appear over links in the Package Inspector.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to thank the Academy and express my appreciation to:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>First and foremost, Christoph Pfisterer for creating Fink, without which FinkCommander would be nothing but an empty table and a bunch of useless menus and buttons.</p></li>

	<li><p>Max Horn and David Morrison for carrying on so capably as project administrators after Christoph left.</p></li>

	<li><p>Co-developers Sylvain Cuaz and Pedro Masobio, who prepared the French and Spanish localizations for FinkCommander and have helped out in numerous other ways.</p></li>

	<li><p>Justin Hallett, Ben Hines, Dave Vasilevsky and Brian Lenihan who helped me debug the problems FinkCommander experienced with pre-release versions of Jaguar.  Thay have also submitted helpful comments and suggestions on numerous other elements of FinkCommander.</p></li>

	<li><p>Martin Costabel, who pointed out the correct way of identifying packages available in Fink's binary distribution.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The rest of the fink development team for all the great Unix software they have made easily available to us Mac users.</p></li>
