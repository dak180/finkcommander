<h2>Getting Started with FinkCommander</h2>

<h3 id="startup">Initial Startup</h3>

<p>The first time you run a command in FinkCommander after installing a new 
version, it will announce that it does not have the necessary permissions and 
needs to &quot;self-repair.&quot;  You will then be presented with 
Mac OS X&#039;s security dialog asking for an administrator&#039;s password.     
You will need to enter your password twice and then re-try the command after 
the self-repair process is complete.</p>
  
<p>Once the self-repair is complete, 
you should only need to enter your password once per <a href="#timeout">timeout 
period</a>.</p>

<p>For those with sufficient interest, more information on FinkCommander security is available
<a href="http://finkcommander.sf.net/about/permissions.php">
on the web</a>.</p>

<h3 id="timeout">Changing the Authorization Timeout</h2>

<p> By default, FinkCommander works in much the same way as sudo.  If you
run a command and provide your password to authorize root privileges, that
authorization has a timeout period of five minutes.  You can enter
additional commands without retyping your password for five minutes.  After
that, you need to reauthenticate. </p>

<p> You can customize the timeout for FinkCommander by editing the
/private/etc/authorization file.  To do so, open Terminal and type the
following at the command line: </p>

<p><kbd>sudo [editor] /private/etc/authorization</kbd></p>

<p>where [editor] is the name of your favorite command-line editor. 
You should not use the Property List Editor in /Developer/Applications to edit 
the file, 
because it will fail to preserve the comments.</p>

<p>To eliminate the timeout for FinkCommander, add the following &quot;rule&quot; to the 
authorization file:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;!-- Your comment here --&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;com.sburrious.finkcommander&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;dict&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;group&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;admin&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;shared&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;true/&gt;
        &lt;/dict&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can place these lines before any of the comment lines 
(the lines starting with &quot;&lt;!--&quot;) in the file.  A logical location 
would be right before the final comment introducing the default 
authorization rule. Once you have made these changes, entering your password 
at the beginning of a FinkCommander session will authorize all subsequent 
commands during the session.</p>

<p>To extend or shorten the timeout period, include the following key/value pair
in the lines shown above before the &lt;&nbsp;/dict&gt; tag.</p> 
<pre>
	&lt;key&gt;timeout&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;N&lt;/integer&gt; 
</pre>

<p>Where N is the timeout period in seconds.  To require a password for each
command, set N to 0.</p>

<p>I hope to automate this process in a future release, possibly through
FinkCommander&#039;s Preferences panel.</p>
