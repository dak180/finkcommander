 FinkCommander

 Graphical user interface for Fink, a software package management system
 that automates the downloading, patching, compilation and installation of
 Unix software on Mac OS X.

 The FinkBasePathUtility class finds the path to the user's fink installation
 (ususally /sw) and sets user defaults to reflect it.
