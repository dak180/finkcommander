<h2>Version History</h2>

0.4.1	9/26/2002

<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug:  Output view sometimes collapsed when interaction sheet appeared!</li>
	
	<li>The user can now adjust or eliminate the timeout for FinkCommander's authorization by
	making changes to the /private/etc/authorization file.  Instructions are included in the 
	latest README.</li>
</ul>

0.4.0	9/22/2002

<ul>
	<li>FinkCommander now uses Apple's Security Framework to authorize Fink and
	apt-get commands that require root privileges.  Users will notice three
	differences as a result:
	<ol>
		<li>Apple's password dialog allows the user to enter a user name other than that of
		the current user.  It will now be possible to use FinkCommander from a 
		non-administrator's account.</li>
		<li>FinkCommander's authorization will time out after five minutes, unless the 
		default timeout period has been changed in /private/etc/authorization.  The user 
		will need to re-enter his or her password to run another command.</li>
		<li>The terminate command is <em>much</em> more reliable.</li>
	</ol>
	Thanks to Dave Love, who provided the code for making this long-needed change.</li>	 

	<li>The table display has been improved:  The existing Installed, Binary and
	Unstable columns, as well as the new Stable column, show the appropriate
	version numbers.  The information that formerly appeared under Installation
	("current", "outdated", etc.) now appears in the Status column.</li>
	
	<li>The same version information appears in the Package Inspector.</li>
	
	<li>A determinate progress indicator and more detailed messages in the status bar 
	provide better feedback for source installation commands.</li>
	
	<li>The terminate command is more reliable.</li>
	
	<li>Table rows can now be copied.</li>
	
	<li>The output view can be collapsed or expanded by double clicking the view 
	divider.</li>
</ul>

0.3.3a	8/10/2002

<p>This is a bug fix release.   It adds no new functionality, but fixes two problems with version 0.3.3:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Failure to display the Package Inspector on pre-release versions of Jaguar.</li>
	<li>Code changes that broke the "always choose default response to prompts" option.</li>
</ul>

0.3.3 	8/4/2002

<ul>
	<li>The binary column now marks only those packages that are available in the
	Fink binary distribution.  Previously, as documented in the help system, 
	it also marked packages that had been installed on the user's system from the 
	source distribution.  Thanks to Martin Costabel for providing the information that
	enabled me to fix this long-standing problem.</li>

	<li>A Force Remove command, which runs dpkg --remove --force-depends, has been added to 
	the Source menu.</li>

	<li>A new Environment tab in Preferences allows you to set environment
	variables for fink and apt-get processes.  You can also edit or remove
	environment variables set by FinkCommander, although I wouldn't necessarily
	recommend it.</li>

	<li>The Verbosity item in the Fink Tab has been altered to accomodate a
	pending change to the Fink package manager.  When you install the next
	version of the PM, you should have 4 choices rather than 2 for this
	item.</li>

	<li>There has been another modest reorganization of the Preferences panel. 
	Some items that formerly appeared in the Commander tab are now in a new
	Display tab.  The Uniphobe tab is gone.  Most of its contents are under
	Commander.</li>

	<li>FinkCommander will now automatically check for new versions according to
	a schedule you set in Preferences.  (As always, you can also turn this
	feature off.)</li>

	<li>There is now an optional limit on the number of lines displayed in the
	output view.  The default is 10000 (same as for Terminal), but this can be
	changed or removed entirely in Preferences:Display.</li>

	<li>A bug preventing the table data from loading once Japanese had been
	chosen as the preferred language in System Preferences has been fixed. (I
	hope.)</li>

	<li>The package version number and the version of make on the user's system
	have been added to the information included in emails to package maintainers
	generated by FinkCommander.</li>
</ul>

0.3.2 	7/7/2002

<ul>
    <li>FinkCommander has a new application icon!</li>

    <li>A new View menu allows the user to specify which columns to display,
    including a new package maintainer column.</li> 
    
    <li>The user can now email the maintainer for a selected package via the
    Help menu and a toolbar command as well by clicking the email address in the
    package inspector.</li>

    <li>Emails to package maintainers now include the name of the package in the
    subject line and a signature providing relevant system information.  The
    signature also gives FinkCommander credit for generating the email, but you
    can turn this off in Preferences:Commander.</li> 
    
    <li>A save output command has been added to the File menu.  The save dialog
    provides a default filename consisting of the command and the date.  The
    user can specify a default directory in Preferences:Paths.</li> 
    
    <li>A FinkCommander:Check for Updates menu item has been added. It produces
    a dialog letting the user know whether a more recent version of
    FinkCommander is available for download.</li> 
    
    <li>An optional alert panel displays before FinkCommander runs a remove
    command.</li> 
    
    <li>The zoom behavior of the package inspector panel has been improved.</li>
    
    <li>Fixed bugs: Failure of selfupdate-cvs when run by fink developers with
    secure cvs access.  Inadvertently change in ownership and group ownership of
    fink.conf file.  Memory leaks.</li> 
</ul>

0.3.1   6/11/2002:
<ul>
	<li>The menus and toolbar include a terminate command that
actually works most of the time.  When it doesn't, the user is offered
the opportunity to quit the application.</li>
	
	<li>An info panel that displays the full description for the
selected package(s) has been added.  The full description is now
cached, so it can be accessed while a command is running.</li>
	
	<li>Clicking on the package web site or maintainer e-mail address
in the info panel will open the url in the user's preferred web
browser or mail application.</li>
	
	<li>Package specific commands can now be accessed through a
contextual menu in the table view.</li>

	<li>Preferences can now be set for all fink.conf parameters except
for base path (which should be set properly before FinkCommander is
installed) and download mirrors.</li>
	
	<li>The number of displayed packages and packages installed is now
shown in the window title bar rather than at the bottom of the main
window.  A Preference item allows the user to switch back to the old
display.</li>
	
	<li>The layout of the Preferences panel has been improved (I
hope).</li>
	
	<li>Basic scripting support is now included.  You can now start
and quit FinkCommander with AppleScript.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed reported bugs: Version number is now displayed in
Finder.  The maximum window size is no longer limited.  FinkCommander
no longer crashes if the user moves the fink installation while
FinkCommander is running.  </li>
</ul>

0.3.0 5/12/2002: <ul> <li>Fink.conf can now be modified using the
Preferences panel</li>
	
	<li>Output window scrolling behavior now mimics Terminal.app:
Unless the user chooses "Scroll to the bottom . . ." in Preferences,
the user can now scroll up to view previous output without having the
scroller zip back down to the bottom every time new output is
added</li>
	
	<li>Other new preference items: warn before running a command (as
requested), never ask for password (for users who have configured sudo
accordingly), ask for password on startup</li>
	
	<li>All fields except version can now be filtered</li>
	
	<li>Additional available toolbar items: selfupdate, apt-get
update, selfupdate-cvs, describe, interact with Fink</li>
	
	<li>Help now includes instructions on running commands and on
setting Preferences</li>
</ul>

0.2.1a	4/27/2002:

	Fixed bug preventing use of apt-get from behind firewall

0.2.1	4/24/2002:
<ul>

	<li>Added menu item allowing user to summon interaction sheet</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug causing crash on startup if Fink not installed in
one of certain directories</li>
</ul>
	
0.2.0	4/20/2002:
<ul>
	<li>First binary release</li>

	<li>Added toolbar, which includes an incremental filter for table
data</li>

	<li>Added progress indicator bar that appears at bottom of window
when table is updating</li>

	<li>Moved status/package number message to bottom of window</li>
	
	<li>Added warning alert when user attempts to quit Fink while a
command is still running</li>
    
    <li>Full table update performed after error message detected</li>

    <li>Disabled row selection and added alert when user selects
package FC cannot install (just tcsh, at this point)</li>

    <li>Cleaned up some memory allocation errors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pre-Binary Release Version History (plain text)</h2>
<pre>

0.1.3	04/05/2002:

    First SourceForge release
    
    /sw no longer hard-coded as fink directory path
    
    FC now searches for path, sets user defaults to reflect result
    and writes path into fpkg_list.pl script
    
    Interaction with Fink prompts enabled through sheet dialog
    that appears whenever input is needed. Password only entered
    when needed.
    
    Added preferences panel: accept Fink defaults automatically
    when running commands; set fink directory path manually, if
    search method doesn't work; always update table data with fink
    commands; scroll to last selection after sort.
    
    Window position and table column states now saved between
    sessions
    
    Table selection no longer disabled while command is running;
    no longer necessary for update.
    
    Message text now signals when a full update of the package
    data is occurring.
    
    The table now resorts after a full update of the package data
    
    FinkCommander now has its own icon!  Since I'm no artist, it's
    ugly, but at least it makes identifying FinkCommander easier
    than the generic application icon

0.1.2	03/10/2002:

    Added table column showing whether package is unstable.
    
    Password entry sheet now appears automatically the first time
    a command is attempted; also after invalid password alert is
    dismissed; basically an improved implementation of the
    password entry procedure in 0.1
    
    FC disables Source and Binary menus and table row selection
    while command is running
    
    Added Selfupdate-cvs to Source menu and Remove to Binary menu
    
    Removed commands from the Binary menu that do not appear
    useful; users should let me know if I went too far! 
    
    System beeps when command finishes (Woo woo!)

0.1.1	03/05/2002:

    Added explicit data encoding to methods sending text to
    standard input of NSTask; passing C string as data may have
    been cause of a reported user crash
    
    Simplified password entry procedures, another possible cause
    of the crash
    
    The current procedure is in any case a placeholder until I can
    figure out how to work in the Security Framework functions
    
    Eliminated error-prone method for determining user's Fink
    directory, which may have caused a reported failure of the
    table to load on one user's system
    
    Added documentation

0.1	03/03/2002: Initial release, errors galore reported.
