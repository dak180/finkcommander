DESIGN

Separate components that handle running Fink commands from the GUI components to allow easy substitution of an ObjC-Perl bridge solution when it becomes available.  See DESIGN.txt for more detail.


FUNCTIONALITY

Add support for entry of CVS password
Allow user to send interrupt message to hanging process
Add preferences panel with tabs:
	Manually select path to fink directory tree -- done 3/29/02
	Ask-first option for dependency and virtual dependency installation
	Select columns to be viewed (see O'Reilly Cocoa tutorial on preferences)
		Ideally, deselecting the "Binary" and "Unstable" columns should prevent the
		FinkDataController object from running the expensive getBinaryList and getStableList
		methods on startup and whenever the table is updated
	Change fink.conf
Enhance IPC to allow user choice on dependency and virtual dependency installations
Redo authorization and command launch methods to use "correct" approach (see AuthSample)
Filter table by category
Search table
Make application scriptable; possible useful scripts:
	e-mail output from failed install to package maintainer
	e-mail success to unstable package maintainer
Add "stable" column -- done 3/9/02
Disable commands, table selection while command executing -- done 3/9/02


EASE OF USE

Add help
Toolbar; need icons
Contextual menu to run commands by right- or control-clicking in table view
Additional visual clue that command is done, like circling arrows in Mail and OmniWeb


COSMETICS

Custom application icon
Use image to show binary, unstable packages, instead of asterisk
