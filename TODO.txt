DESIGN

Separate components that handle running Fink commands from the GUI components to allow easy substitution of an ObjC-Perl bridge solution when it becomes available.  See DESIGN.txt for more details.
Use fink list -t instead of fpkg_list.pl to gather package information.  Add method to determine package's category (section).
