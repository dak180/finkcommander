FUNCTIONALITY

Run command in terminal option

Find panel for output view

Custom script suite

**Long Term

Architecture changes: 

	     table view methods in separate class file (can a
	     table view be its own delegate?); this will open the door
	     to switching in other views without dumping all of the
	     necessary code into FinkController; creating the table
	     programmatically will make it easier to implement the
	     view menu

	     make FinkConf self-sufficient in terms of making changes
	     to fink.conf file; both FinkConf and FinkController
	     should post notifications when start and stop command;
	     FinkController can use these to set interface elements
	     appropriately (e.g. disable menus, start progress bar);
	     FinkConf can use them to schedule tasks

View menu: select rows to display; see O'Reilly cocoa tutorial
